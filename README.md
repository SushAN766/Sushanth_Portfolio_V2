#  Codeverse

Welcome to **Codeverse** â€” my personal developer portfolio, built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and plenty of coffee .

This site is a reflection of my journey as a developer â€” from projects I've built, to technologies I love, and the creative universe I continue to explore.

#  About Me
Iâ€™m Sushanth, a passionate developer with an eye for design and a love for clean code. This portfolio is a window into my world â€” the Codeverse.
